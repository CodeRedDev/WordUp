# WordUp
WordUp is an Android open source framework for creating soundboard apps.

While currently under development it should help developers to create their own soundboard app in almost no time.

First steps of this project will be to build a strong local base where sounds will be saved in the apps assets.

Future features should include the ability to host sounds on a server.
